# JUNO-60 Editor

JUNO-60 Editor is a **WIP** web application for loading and saving patch dumps as well as modifying them for the Roland JUNO-60 synthesizer. Released in 1982, it uses a dated tape interface for backing up and restoring these patch dumps on to a device which was typically a tape recorder. I am currently creating this application to allow users to store their patches on a computer in the form of a .wav file which can be imported into the app, edited, exported back into a .wav file, then finally loaded into the synthesizer.
